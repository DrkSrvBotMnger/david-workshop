# 📈 Roadmap – David's Workshop Bot

Tracking development phases, feature sets, and future ideas.

---

## ✅ Completed

- Profile system (points, equipped title, badges)
- Event system with metadata, logs, visibility flags
- Reward shop, warehouse viewer, and linking to events
- Admin/mod commands for manual actions
- Paginated embeds and user-friendly navigation

---

## 🧩 Phase 0.5: SQLite Migration Plan (to replace JSON)

This phase runs **in parallel** with Phase 1, gradually moving away from JSON persistence.

- [ ] Install and configure `SQLAlchemy` for SQLite
- [✅️] Create initial schema:
  - `users`, `events`
- [ ] Create initial schema `actions`, `user_actions`
- [ ] Check potential missing metadata in `userevent_data` and `invertory_item`
- [ ] Replace:
  - [ ] `get_user_data()` → DB call
  - [ ] `create_event()` → DB insert
  - [ ] `log_event_action()` → DB log
  - [ ] `get_events()` → DB query
- [ ] Add DB-based `/profile`, `/eventlist`, `/eventsubmit`
- [ ] Confirm that all legacy JSON calls are removed or refactored
- [ ] Implement backup/export feature (CSV or JSON dump for admin)

Eventually:
- [ ] Add `badges`, `titles`, `shop_items`, `purchases` to DB

---

## 🧠 Notes:
- JSON files will remain during transition, but eventually become read-only backups
- DB file will be stored as `data.db` (and excluded from Git)

---

## 🚧 Phase 1: Freeform Event System (current focus)

- [ ] type field added to events ("freeform", "bingo", "exchange")
- [ ] `create_event()` and admin command updated to support type
- [ ] User action logging system (user_actions.json)
- [ ] `/eventsubmit` — user self-logs an action
- [ ] `/eventmyscore` — user view of own score for current event
- [ ] `/eventleaderboard` — ranks users per event
- [ ] Showcase media (if configured in action)
- [ ] `/eventlogaction` (admin override to log for others)
- [ ] `/eventundoaction` (admin undo)
- [ ] Badge/title assigned on event join or completion

---

## 🎮 Phase 2: Profile Rework, Gamification & Shop Expansion

- [ ] Store total_points_earned, total_points_spent
- [ ] Add event history to user profiles (events joined, points earned)
- [ ] /profile shows:
  - [ ] Active title
  - [ ] Badges (with emoji)
  - [ ] Points (current / earned)
  - [ ] Events attended
- [ ] Add /badges to view full badge list
- [ ] `/shop` to browse items
- [ ] `/buy` to spend points
- [ ] `/inventory` for titles/badges/items
- [ ] `/equip title` to change public title
- [ ] Badge & title visuals in `/profile`

---

## 🎄 Phase 3: Event Types & Structured Signup

- [ ] Add `bingo` event logic: prompt grid, per-prompt scoring
- [ ] Add `exchange` event logic: signup + assignment + completion
- [ ] `/eventsignup` — structured signup command for exchange-type events
    - [ ] AO3, Tumblr, email, DNWs, preferences
    - [ ] Stored securely in `user_event_data`
- [ ] Cleanup tool: `/cleansensitive @event` to remove AO3/email/etc.
    - [ ] Mod-only command
    - [ ] Clears fields post-event or by request

---

## 🧼 Maintenance Tasks

- [ ] Clean inactive users from `users.json`
- [ ] Backup logs externally (not in Git)
- [ ] Add type annotations in `utils.py`
- [ ] Expand error logging and validation

---

## 🧪 Phase 4: Automated Testing & Developer Safety Nets

Ensure the stability and future maintainability of the bot through automated tests, fake data, and dev tooling.

### ✅ Setup

- [ ] Create `/tests/` directory in project
- [ ] Set up Python’s `unittest` framework
- [ ] Add base test runner script: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
- [ ] (Optional) Install `pytest` for improved output formatting

### 🧹 Data Generation

- [ ] `tests/fake_data.py`
    - [ ] `generate_fake_users(count=5)`
    - [ ] `generate_fake_events(count=3)`
- [ ] (Optional) `tests/truncate_db.py` to clear DB between test runs

### 🧪 Core Test Suites

- [ ] `test_users.py`
    - [ ] Users are created successfully
    - [ ] Points are valid integers
    - [ ] No duplicate Discord IDs

- [ ] `test_events.py`
    - [ ] Event creation works with correct structure
    - [ ] Default values for `active` and `visible` are respected
    - [ ] Supported types only (freeform, bingo, exchange)

- [ ] `test_actions.py` (after `user_actions` table exists)
    - [ ] User actions log correctly
    - [ ] Points are calculated and stored
    - [ ] Admin action logging functions correctly

- [ ] `test_profiles.py`
    - [ ] Profile fetch reflects correct totals
    - [ ] Equipped title is tracked properly
    - [ ] Handles empty profiles gracefully

### 🔧 Developer Tooling

- [ ] Add testing instructions to `dev-notes.md`
- [ ] (Optional) Create `pytest.ini` with:
- [ ] Configure Replit “Tests” tab to run suite automatically (optional)

### 🧘 Future-Safe Practices

- [ ] Run full test suite before schema changes or major updates
- [ ] Add regression tests for /eventsubmit, /shop, /inventory
- [ ] Write validation tests for bingo, exchange, and other new event types
